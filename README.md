Hi! I'm Quentin! I'm a recent graduate with my degree in Computer Science, and I really love doing game design, web development, and software engineering. The languages I'm best with are Python, C#, C++, and Java! But that's just my favorite programming languages. I also really love SQL, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript, and I've made a lot of projects with react!
